### What and Why?
The app will match you up with similar people to you to hopefully be friends with! 

In an increasingly digitalized society where alternatives to regular social interactions become more easier and easier to access, for example, YouTubers in collaborations, talk shows, PodCasts, people have less incentives to form real relationships, since these alternatives have idealized social interactions, which are unfortunately unattainable by the listener. By matching people based on their hobbies, ethical belifs, political beliefs, and any other part that makes their identities, the app removes the most painful part of forming actual relationships: talking about fake, socially acceptable topics which they personally do not have any interest in.

### How?
The app will ask for certain pre-defined hobbies and beliefs with the option to add additional topics

### For whom?
This is targeted towards introverts and shy people that are more prevalent in today's society due to less social interactions, who do not want to have to go through painful, awkward conversations to get to the meat of the conversation. 

### Scope
In basics, the project seems fairly easy to implement: simply match users with similar values. However, it is easy to expand upon the complexity, by implementing predictive algorithms that could match hobbies that they did not indicate they hold by seeing what other hobbies other users with similar hobbies hold. Also, the app could ask for feedback on how the friendship turned out, from which more changes to the matching process could be made.
